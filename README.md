# Airline-Satisfaction-ML-KNIME
This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction levels using a dataset from an airline company. We applied three different machine learning classifiers: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), utilizing the KNIME analytics platform to build and evaluate these models.
Objectives
•	To predict customer satisfaction based on various service parameters.
•	To compare the effectiveness of three classifiers in handling the prediction task.
•	To determine the best model based on accuracy and other performance metrics.
